The series 'Drape' is currently being exhibited at Open Eye Gallery in Liverpool. Eva Stenram brings together 
analogical archival material and digital manipulation, creating scenarios where the uncanny takes centre stage. 
Stenram often uses found images, such as the negatives of pin-up shoots and thumbed centrefolds taken from old
magazines, as her source of inspiration and working material.  These are scanned and imported to digital files 
that the artist manipulates, reinterpreting at each time the image anew. In the Drape series (2011-2012), the 
background − the drapes that give the show its title – and foreground are exchanged. Once the backdrop falls in 
front of the model (negating access to the subject and only showing glimpses of her objectified body), the viewer
becomes fully aware of their voyeuristic desire and erotic impulses. © All Images
