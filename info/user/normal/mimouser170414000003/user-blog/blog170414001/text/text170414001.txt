‘shas released its “Greats edition” and the featured subject is none other thanLady Gaga.

“It’s an endless proving of myself, that I really am a musician, that I have something to offer in the room. That women can be musicians, women can be rock stars, women can be more than an objectified idea of a pop star.” – Gaga on representing women.

“I get blocked by my own trauma sometimes. The darkness, the loop of negative thoughts on repeat, clamors and interferes with the music I hear in my head. When I’m making music, I can hear all the parts, all the instruments. I can hear what it should be.” – Gaga on writing songs.
